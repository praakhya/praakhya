In the past year I have been trying to set up a website to showcase my art work. I required a carousel for the same. The existing carousel components did not meet my requirements. So, I created one carousel component in React, and published it in npm.

- NPM Page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/customizable-horizontal-carousel


- My complete open-source contribution is in my GitHub repository here: https://github.com/praakhya


- I also have a live website for my art coded in Angular and it is hosted here: https://lifeisasketch.avasthi.com/
